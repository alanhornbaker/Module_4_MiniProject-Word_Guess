//Here I'll be writing the code for the function that captures the users
//guess as a key event



//Psuedo-Code:

//addEVentListener for keyEvent
    //should only be accepting alphabetical inputs
    //should only accept letters that haven't been guessed already
    //

//data from the keyevent to be captured in localStorage as user guess
//user guess should be storage as a var or whatever, to make it easier
//to call on and use later on.
